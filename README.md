# Titanic Survival Prediction Model

**Overview**
This project aims to build a predictive model that determines whether a passenger aboard the Titanic survived or not. The dataset used for this project contains information about individual passengers, including their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and survival status.

**Dataset**
The dataset used for this project is the Titanic dataset, which is a classic dataset often used for beginner machine learning projects. It contains information on 891 passengers aboard the Titanic, including whether they survived or not. The dataset is readily available and can be found in various sources, including Kaggle.

**Data Exploration:**
Understanding the structure of the dataset.
Exploring the variables and their distributions.
Handling missing values and outliers.
Feature Engineering:

Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.
Handling categorical variables through techniques such as one-hot encoding.

**Model Building:**
Selecting appropriate algorithms for classification (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines).
Training the model on the training dataset.
Evaluating the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

**Model Tuning:**
Fine-tuning hyperparameters to improve model performance.
Utilizing techniques like cross-validation to avoid overfitting.

**Model Deployment:**
Deploying the trained model for practical use.
Creating a user-friendly interface for making predictions (if applicable).
